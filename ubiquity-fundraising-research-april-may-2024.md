## Introduction
The goal of the research is to obtain objective information about the perception of Ubiquity in order to develop materials and communications for investors to secure a funding round. During April and May 2024, Sergey found and conducted interviews with 8 crypto influencers and investors who have extensive experience in investing in crypto projects.

To obtain objective feedback and information, the conversations were conducted anonymously, in the format of interviews with experts, not as a pitch to investors. Experts were provided with Ubiquity's public materials and no internal information was provided. Some experts conducted their own research to comprehensively assess Ubiquity.

The trigger for starting the research was Sergey's interaction in March-April 2024 with an agency that supported ChainGPT. Previously, Sergey believed that he objectively assessed Ubiquity's situation, but it turned out during the interaction with the agency that this might not be the case. According to the agency's assessment in March 2024, Ubiquity had low market potential.

Sergey presumed that investors might come to a similar assessment, which would significantly hinder Ubiquity's ability to obtain the next funding round. Seeing Ubiquity through the eyes of independent expert investors, Alex and Sergey could build investor communication in such a way as to highlight Ubiquity's strengths and mitigate its weaknesses. Observing Alex's approach to finding investors, Sergey believes that this research will significantly save time for Ubiquity in preparing for the next funding round.

This is a brief version of the report that represents information obtained from experts, aggregated by the end of June 2024. Part of the information and recommendations received from experts have not yet been aggregated and are not included in this report. The research took over 2 months almost full-time, while Sergey was only paid for one month. The rest of the information will be aggregated and provided later if Sergey has time or if he is paid for it.

## Investments
Ubiquity's ability to retain the amount of investments received in the previous round commands deep respect. Such a situation is a strong positive signal to investors that their funds are managed efficiently. It is desirable for such information to be confirmed by facts that investors can verify.

### Funding Round
Since Ubiquity has funds from the previous round, it remains unclear for what purposes to attract a new investment round. To justify the need for additional funding, it is necessary to provide a reasoned development strategy for Ubiquity with directions for using capital.

Typically, more effective times for investments are autumn and spring, summer being the least active period. It is better to start contacting investors at the beginning of autumn 2024.

### Investors
Experts asked whether Ubiquity is approaching current investors with an offer to participate in a new funding round. If investors familiar with Ubiquity are expanding their investments, this is a positive signal. If none of the existing investors wish to expand their investments in Ubiquity, this could be a negative signal. Investors communicate with each other and will try to get feedback about Ubiquity from current investors.

### Valuation
One of the approaches to determining valuation is market references. Experts listed several companies with which they will compare Ubiquity to determine valuation:

- Tea protocol

[https://tea.xyz/](https://tea.xyz/)

- Talent protocol

[https://www.talentprotocol.com/](https://www.talentprotocol.com/)

[https://www.build.top/](https://www.build.top/)

- BuildAI

## Tokenomics
Tokenomics is one of the most important parts of a project evaluation. From the experts' point of view, the tokenomics of Ubiquity's tokens are opaque and risky. Although the distribution of UBQ tokens is unclear, presumably high inflation of UBQ tokens could lead to a decrease in the value of investments. Investors need to know the main parameters - token distribution, conditions (cliff, vesting, etc), and expected valuation. 

Questions arise regarding the Ubiquity Dollar about mechanisms for maintaining stability, issuance, prevalence, and regulation. Most experts noted that most tokens launched in 2024 are losing their value, and they would like to see a plan for investor exits or for maintaining the value of UBQ.

## Team
Not counting Sergey, the Ubiquity team is anonymous, which is common for crypto projects. This does not significantly add or reduce investor trust. From the perspective of public promotion, it is necessary to have influencers who will be the voice of the project. Typically, investors want to see a cohesive team because companies with solo entrepreneurs are less stable.

### GitHub
Most experts highly rated Ubiquity's GitHub. A large number of actively discussed repositories distinctly distinguishes Ubiquity from many projects. One expert suggested comparing the activity with the repositories of popular crypto projects, in particular, Eigen Foundation [https://github.com/eigenfoundation](https://github.com/eigenfoundation).

## Market and Competition
In its materials, Ubiquity has not clearly shown which market it serves and what problems it solves. Listed problems and solutions do not distinguish Ubiquity from other products. The competitive environment for Ubiquity is incorrectly defined. For each of Ubiquity's product lines, it is necessary to define the competitive environment. Companies described as competitors based on the AI platform criterion are not direct competitors because Ubiquity is not an AI platform. An analysis found no AI products and services offered by Ubiquity. Using LLM via API does not place it alongside companies that train their own models or create solutions using complex prompts. Experts see a wave of projects trying to use the AI + crypto theme. If a project lacks AI competence like Ubiquity, such positioning is perceived negatively.

Similar systems to those offered by Ubiquity are not popular on GitHub

However, similar systems exist, and some of them have more installations than Ubiquity:

- Feature bot

## Products and Users

### Users
Experts note the near absence of users and partners, which does not provide an opportunity to assess traction.

### Product Portfolio
As Ubiquity has practically no clients, there is no reason to believe that Ubiquity has found a product-market fit. Some investors speculated that Ubiquity does not have a clear vision and changes its course. Other experts noted discrepancies and incompleteness of information in materials, on the website, on GitHub, and on social networks of Ubiquity.

### Stablecoin
The presence of a stablecoin as a product requires quality documentation. As an example of documentation, one could use the documentation of Ethena [https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs). An unregulated MiCA stablecoin will reduce interest from investors who finance companies in the EEA territory.

### Community and Marketing
It was difficult to understand what exactly Ubiquity does, as information in the presentation, on the website, on GitHub, and on social networks differs. Twitter score has a rating of 5 (bad) [https://twitterscore.io/twitter/UbiquityDAO/overview/](https://twitterscore.io/twitter/UbiquityDAO/overview/). A strong community supporting the project was not found, nor were there marketing activities that create interest and hype for the project.

### Investor Presentation
Overall, experts do not consider the design of the presentation an important factor, although they recommended more visual slides to unfold the concepts of Ubiquity.
